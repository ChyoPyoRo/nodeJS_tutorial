    JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm
    , and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of W
    orld Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online p
    rograms, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without
    the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of 
    JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting 
    additional features beyond ECMA.
